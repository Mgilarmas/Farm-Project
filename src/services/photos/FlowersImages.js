    plant:"Tulip bulbs are planted in the autumn, 6 to 8 weeks before the ground freezes. You can have tulips blooming from early to late spring by planting varieties with different bloom times. Some types are good for forcing into bloom indoors, and most are excellent for use as cut flowers, too."

    plant:"If you are buying potted roses, it’s best to plant them by late spring for best results. However, you may plant them almost any time during the growing season—just be sure to keep them well-watered, especially during summer!"

    plant:"Annual poppies can be planted in fall or early spring when there is still frost at night, but the soil is exposed. Planting in fall mimics the natural processes and makes one less thing to do in spring when you are already busy!"

    name: "Lilies",
    plant:"Lilies are commonly planted in the fall but can be planted in the spring in areas with harsh winters. In the fall, plant at least four weeks before your first fall frost date. Bulbs planted in the autumn will have well-established roots in the spring. The bulbs benefit from a winter chill to produce big blooms. In the spring, plant them as soon as the threat of frost has passed."

    plant:"Direct-seed outdoors in early spring when a light frost is still possible. If transplanting a small nursery plant, plant during the cooler months in spring or fall to encourage deep rooting. If sowing seeds indoors, start them 10 to 12 weeks before the last spring frost."
